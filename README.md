# VR development test starter

This is a starter unity project with basic settings and models for a VR development technical test. Since this is a barebones project,
anyone performing the test is free to choose their own VR framework to install, and other settings, like render pipeline, etc.

The test objective is to make the door in the "starter scene" interactive in VR. The user should be able to open the door by using the 
door handle (being able to walk through or move around via some form of locomotion etc is optional). Some kind of UI / audio should 
be made available to the user of this test to let them know how to open the door, and use any other functionality you choose to include. 
Performing the door opening in VR should feel good and natural to the user.

The main goal of this test is to assess your technical skills and should only take a few hours to perform, but we also encourage you 
to be creative!
